We provide an extremely easy way for salons to sell product online by linking them directly to distributors around the US. You could think of it as an out-of-the-box ready platform for dropshipping, but it's more complex in terms of both code and partnerships than that makes it sound. The complexity in the space gives us interesting problems to work on in the near term, and makes the business defensible in the long term.\n\nOur current goals can be summed up simply: provide a more modern, more beautiful, more streamlined experience for all of our partners, of which there are many. Salons, stylists, consumers, distributors, brands, us (SalonInteractive), and more. We are accomplishing this goal by redesigning and rearchitecting much of our core application. It's an exciting time.\n\nWe want to deliver a product that is high quality inside and out. One that helps our partners capitalize on real opportunities, and gives us flexibility to meet the as-yet-unknown needs of the future. To this end, the engineering team works closely with stakeholders to combine their understanding of problems and opportunities with our understanding of engineering to craft effective solutions.\n\n## Your Day-to-day\n\nThis is a hands-on, fully-remote programming position. You'll be working on our Ruby on Rails based eCommerce platform backend, as well as the Tailwind/AlpineJS frontend. The core technologies youâll be working withâand need to be familiar for success in this roleâare Ruby, HTML, CSS, and JS.\n\nWe have a large number of high-impact projects planned for the platform. You'll work closely with the CTO, our existing development team, and other stakeholders both within the company and outside of it to understand needs and develop solutions. Your responsibilities will include designing, developing and deploying code to best serve our customers and partners.\n\nAs mentioned before, we have quite a bit of work planned for the next few months, so an ideal applicant will be ready to hit the ground running. Despite the amount of work we have, we strive to minimize context switchingâif youâre on a project, you shouldnât expect to be bombarded with unrelated tweaks on other projects here and there thoughâas with any companyâit does happen to some extent.\n\nWe're a small but quickly growing post-revenue startup. As one of the early hires, there is opportunity for this to be a high impact position. An appropriately ambitious individual will have huge opportunity to lay the groundwork for the company's future.\n\n## Some Notes on Culture\n\nHere are some of our values. Theyâre always being refined based on what works and what doesnât.\n\n- We value clear, concise communication.\n- Ask questions. You can only produce high quality work if you have a clear understanding of the problem and the constraints.\n- Contextâunderstanding our partners and their stakeholdersâempowers individual contributors to find better solutions.\n- Free up time for interesting problems by automating repeatable tasks and learning your tools inside and out.\n- No process for processâ sake. No meetings for meetingsâ sake. But we respect that there *is* a place for both.\n- Individual productivity is important, and hugely dependent on a minimally distracting, supportive environment.\n\n## Technical Responsibilities\n\nWhen you start, this is what you can expect to work on.\n\n- Designing the technical architecture of large new components for the system\n- Implementation of features on the platform\n- Implementing designs in CSS/HTML/JS\n- Configuring and tuning middleware services, Redis, ElasticSearch, etc.\n- Integrating with 3rd party APIs and developing our own for public consumption\n\n## Qualifications\n\nThese are the must haves. Basically: be a Ruby web developer!\n\n- 3â5+ years of industry experience\n- Hands-on programming experience with Ruby\n- Proficient in HTML, CSS, and JS\n- Git experience\n- Understand the webâREST, HTTP verbs, basic HTTP status codes, etc.\n- Familiarity with the Unix command line\n\n## Ideal Qualifications\n\nIf you fulfill the above *and* have experience with a few of the below, definitely get in touch.\n\n- Hands-on programming experience with Ruby on Rails\n- Enterprise software development\n- Strong UX/UI chops\n- Deep understanding building complex database queries, particularly MySQL\n- Opinionated about designâvisual and code\n- A portfolio of personal projects (not necessarily code related)","location":"Worldwide","original":true,"url":"https://remoteok.io/remote-jobs/101449-remote-full-stack-developer-saloninteractive","apply_url":"https://remoteok.io/l/101449"},{"slug":"101445-remote-senior-python-django-developer-zibasec","id":"101445","epoch":"1610987591","date":"2021-01-18T16:33:11+00:00","company":"ZibaSec","company_logo":"https://remoteok.io/assets/jobs/9655c358832e310d7f9acb9268d0dc3f1610987591.png","position":"Senior Python Django Developer","tags":["django","python","aws","dev","senior","digital nomad"],"logo":"https://remoteok.io/assets/jobs/9655c358832e310d7f9acb9268d0dc3f1610987591.png","description":"We're looking for someone who has experience with:\n\n- Deep Django experience\n- Postgres (ideally within AWS RDS)\n- Programmatic SMS\n\nWhile are looking for deep proficiency in Python. Experience with any of the following is an additional asset:\n\n- Linux\n- Nodejs\n- AWS Lambda/Serverless\n- AWS SDK\n- Writing CLIs\n- AWS SNS, Twilio, or similar\n\n# About ZibaSec\n\nThe best way to learn about our company is to look at our publicly available employee handbook at [https://www.notion.so/zibasec/Our-Why-f5245149408f4f43baad7ef4de4e0a91](https://www.notion.so/zibasec/Our-Why-f5245149408f4f43baad7ef4de4e0a91)\n\nWeâre an early stage, funded startup focused on helping organizations improve their security posture. We build easy-to-use tools that make it harder for attackers to exploit the people within an organization.\n\nOur flagship product is focused on helping organizations run email phishing campaigns against their own employees. This lets organizations assess their risk levels while also providing insight as to what type of training might be necessary for their organization.\n\nWe are a growing company and can promise you the following:\n\n- A diverse organization.\n- A safe workplace with zero tolerance for discrimination and harassment of any kind.\n- A solid workstation; your choice of a Linux, Mac, or Windows laptop.\n- A 100% remote and balanced work life. We actually prefer you don't work for more than 40 hours a week. We don't have VCs or other outside entities to answer to, and we rather our people have a balanced life than no life.\n- Flexible scheduling. Early riser? Night owl? No problem. We maintain an overlapping 3-hour window for synchronous work. Other than that, work any hours that work for you!\n- We're a tight-knit group and we value each other. Your voice will carry the same weight as anyone else.\n- You'll have dedicated time to learn, and a budget to pay for it.\n\n# **ZibaSec's Core Software Beliefs**\n\n- **Testing is important:**Â Untested code does not get shipped...but hitting 100% unit test coverage can be detrimental to productivity for no or very little gain; it's about the right balance. We're more fond of integration and end-to-end testing.\n- **Git activity != actual productivity:**Â Developers need time to debug locally, research, and learn.\n- **Continuous Deployment:**Â When code is ready, passes tests, it should make it into production within minutes.\n- **Readability > clever code:**Â Slick code isn't so slick if it's hard to grok.\n- **Continuous Improvement:**Â Everything can be improved and nobody knows any code, stack, framework perfectly; there is always room to learn and improve. In fact, we'll provide you with a budget that you can spend on learning (conferences, courses, etc).\n- **Dogma is bad:**Â Some method, technique, etc., may have been the right answer 100 times, but on the 101st time it's possible that another way could be the best path.\n- **Open Source is crucial:**Â As a company, we're very involved with open source, we are active consumers and contributors to multiple projects. We feel so strongly about this that if we find that a particular internal library could be beneficial to the outside world, then we take the time to package it up and open source it as a standalone library (we did exactly this for a Django SAML2 authentication back end).","location":"United States","original":true,"url":"https://remoteok.io/remote-jobs/101445-remote-senior-python-django-developer-zibasec","apply_url":"https://remoteok.io/l/101445"},{"slug":"101443-remote-go-software-engineer-scylladb","id":"101443","epoch":"1610979310","date":"2021-01-18T14:15:10+00:00","company":"ScyllaDB","company_logo":"","position":"Go Software Engineer","tags":["golang","dev","engineer","digital nomad"],"description":"Israel, Israel - Join the team building the new generation of distributed NoSQL database: Scylla Cloud, our Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS).Scylla Cloud provides managed Scylla clusters with automatic backup, upgrades, repairs, performance optimization, security hardening, 24*7 maintenance, moni...","location":"","url":"https://remoteok.io/remote-jobs/101443-remote-go-software-engineer-scylladb","apply_url":"https://remoteok.io/l/101443"},{"slug":"101441-remote-full-stack-software-engineer-psychology-today","id":"101441","epoch":"1610942409","date":"2021-01-18T04:00:09+00:00","company":"Psychology Today","company_logo":"https://remoteok.io/assets/jobs/9210f61ecb9246c3c0c413528160ae271611388832.jpg","position":"Full Stack Software Engineer (New York, NY)","tags":["full stack","dev","engineer","digital nomad"],"logo":"https://remoteok.io/assets/jobs/9210f61ecb9246c3c0c413528160ae271611388832.jpg","description":"<p><br></p><p><strong>ABOUT US:</strong></p><p>We're the world's #1 Psychology site read by over 40 Million people a month, and our Therapy Directory helps millions of clients find the <em>right</em> Therapist.

The main responsibility for this role is to produce high quality code that is robust, including designing data models for scalability and performance.\n \nOne area our application is growing into is Documents management, so having previous experience in similar problems areas, like revision and approval workflows, auditing of projects, access control levels (ACL) is a big plus for this position.\n\nPrevious experience on managing projects and leading a team of developers is a prerequisite for this role. You will be working as part of a small and highly effective 100% remote team, taking part in major technical decisions, defining technical requirements, scoping and helping to create new features for our Bimsync application with the team. \n\nAs one of the lead developers in the team, you are expected to have a good structural thinking, being able to break-down complex problems into smaller parts that can be delivered to production independently in a timeboxed fashion. \n# What we are looking for\nWe believe in a growing and learning mindset, where people will be up to face a new challenge and learn a new technology when needed. Thus, having the right skills and a positive attitude to learning is more important for us than the degree. A BS/MS degree in Computer Science, Engineering or related subject is important, as we value an understanding of the fundamentals, but itâs not a prerequisite.\n\nWe define ourselves as an agile company, so being open for feedback and adapting to change is core to being a good fit to our team. Our company's working language is English, so we expect all candidates to effectively communicate (written and spoken).\n\nAs a lead developer, you are expected to be an excellent communicator, able to consider different points of view (Product, Sales, other devs) and manage these expectations in order to settle and deliver on a plan.\n\nYou should have a very good understanding of backend technologies and the different challenges of creating backend services that are cloud native, having previously developed applications in the public cloud (AWS preferably). We expect a strong intimacy with Java, as most of our backend stack is written in this language. We also look for proficient knowledge of databases, both SQL and NoSQL, to tune and shape the best data structures for each specific microservice. Another important point is having familiarity with REST APIs and a good understanding of backwards compatibility for public APIs. An interest and an ability to fix and contribute to the frontend React code is a bonus point for this position.\n\nThis position is open for fully remote, but has a requirement of being located in the EU.\n# What we offer\nYou will be part of an amazing journey to transform the construction industry with a bold and caring team. Along this path, we will challenge each other, have difficult open conversations and develop, as we learn.\n\nIn addition to the above, we will also take care of you and provide you with the right challenges for growth. Some of our benefits:\n\n* Paid time off (25 vacation days per year)\n* Flexible working hours\n* Full remote possible\n* Share options program\n* Company gatherings twice a year (in person when possible again)\n\n# Location\n**EU**\n\n# About Catenda\nCatenda is a Norwegian scale-up company with a global ambition to make the construction industry data-driven, with less waste and greater transparency along the way.\n\nOur company values are: Openness and Quality.\n\nWe believe in open standards for all our customer data to achieve interoperability between applications, from inception, through design and construction onto the maintenance of a building. Another core belief is that our customers should have full control over their data: all data that goes in, can also be exported out.\n\nWe value quality of the code and the product by working as a tight and effective distributed development team, preferably asynchronously, often sharing screens to collaborate. Catenda has offices in Oslo and Bergen, composed by an international team of 10+ nationalities working remotely across the EU.\n\nOur solution, Bimsync, is a cloud-based collaboration platform, consisting of a web application, a mobile application and our APIs. Many companies across the world are using our products to build better airports, hospitals, stadiums, homes and roads.\n\nOur technology stack runs 100% on AWS, using the most appropriate technology for the problem at hand. Our backend is mostly in Java and we are currently using different managed databases in our backend, like PostgreSQL, MySQL and DocumentDB.

Now entering our 4th year we are pleased to share we have seen serious growth, helped hundreds of thousands of customers, and have a stellar rating (42,000 people give us an average of 4.8 stars at the app store).

Each person has 2-3 projects. Some of our clients are funded start-ups, but most of our work is for well-established companies with meaty problems to solve - like tricky payment flows, security and scaling.</p><br /><p>We value quiet thinkers and creative innovation.

To make great digital things, so many different parts need to come together perfectly - from UX to DevOps.</li><br /><li><strong>We&rsquo;re not an ad agency &amp; we don&rsquo;t outsource.</strong>&nbsp;We build. We&rsquo;re pretty geeky, and while we have content, UX &amp; design people, we&rsquo;re undeniably technical. And to be technically good you need not only good people but excellent processes and a strong tech culture. People that care.&nbsp;</li><br /><li><strong>We work with nice people</strong>&nbsp;as our clients. Life is too short to work with dickheads, and it goes both ways.</li><br /></ol><br /><p><strong>Full time</strong></p><br /><p>This is a full time position. Just in case you&rsquo;re planning out your side hustle. This isn&rsquo;t it. And no, reading that book about the 4h work week and how you have never actually worked out how to quit Vim without turning off your mac and your fiendish plan is to get some guys in Vietnam to do all your dev work is not something you should bring up in the interview. Maybe tell us ahead of time and we can avoid tears later.</p><br /><p><strong>Is this remote or on site?</strong></p><br /><p>Well, with the dreaded COVID 19, everything has changed. We used to all work together in a really nice, light filled office that was located in the very epicentre of HipsterLand, Surry Hills. But since early March, we&rsquo;ve all been working from home.

We&rsquo;re pretty tight operationally. We track what people are working on, how well they&rsquo;re progressing, and how happy they are with their work. Since we changed to work from home, our productivity is way up, sick leave is way down, the teams happy and we&rsquo;re pretty busy. So we&rsquo;re good.</p><br /><p>However not everyone can work from their home, so we&rsquo;re also able to arrange an office if that works better for you.</p><br /><p><strong>How much it pays</strong></p><br /><p>Really well.

Prior experience with serverless architectures is ideal.\n\nThe ideal candidate has experience with programmatically managing AWS infrastructure. We currently use Serverless Framework and Terraform.\n\nWe are looking for expert level proficiency in Python. Experience with any of the following is an additional asset:\n\n- Linux\n- Node\n- Working with the AWS SDK\n- Infrastructure as Code\n- Writing CLIs\n- CI/CD architectures including developing CI-server workflows\n- Terraform (or something similar like Ansible, etc)\n\n## **Weâd be especially interested in you if you have:**\n\n- Contributed to any infrastructure or security automation project in the open source world\n- Built systems around observability and tracing\n- Knowledge on Chaos engineering concepts and theory\n- Fought and won battles against AWS Lambda + AWS API Gateway\n- Worked under the constraints of FedRAMP\n\n# About ZibaSec\n\nThe best way to learn about our company is to look at our publicly available employee handbook at [https://www.notion.so/zibasec/Our-Why-f5245149408f4f43baad7ef4de4e0a91](https://www.notion.so/zibasec/Our-Why-f5245149408f4f43baad7ef4de4e0a91)\n\nWeâre an early stage, funded startup focused on helping organizations improve their security posture. We build easy-to-use tools that make it harder for attackers to exploit the people within an organization.\n\nOur flagship product is focused on helping organizations run email phishing campaigns against their own employees. This lets organizations assess their risk levels while also providing insight as to what type of training might be necessary for their organization.\n\nWe are a growing company and can promise you the following:\n\n- A diverse organization.\n- A safe workplace with zero tolerance for discrimination and harassment of any kind.\n- A solid workstation; your choice of a Linux, Mac, or Windows laptop.\n- A 100% remote and balanced work life. We actually prefer you don't work for more than 40 hours a week. We don't have VCs or other outside entities to answer to, and we rather our people have a balanced life than no life.\n- Flexible scheduling. Early riser? Night owl? No problem. We maintain an overlapping 3-hour window for synchronous work. Other than that, work any hours that work for you!\n- We're a tight-knit group and we value each other. Your voice will carry the same weight as anyone else.\n- You'll have dedicated time to learn, and a budget to pay for it.\n\n# **ZibaSec's Core Software Beliefs**\n\n- **Testing is important:**Â Untested code does not get shipped...but hitting 100% unit test coverage can be detrimental to productivity for no or very little gain; it's about the right balance. We're more fond of integration and end-to-end testing.\n- **Git activity != actual productivity:**Â Developers need time to debug locally, research, and learn.\n- **Continuous Deployment:**Â When code is ready, passes tests, it should make it into production within minutes.\n- **Readability > clever code:**Â Slick code isn't so slick if it's hard to grok.\n- **Continuous Improvement:**Â Everything can be improved and nobody knows any code, stack, framework perfectly; there is always room to learn and improve. In fact, we'll provide you with a budget that you can spend on learning (conferences, courses, etc).\n- **Dogma is bad:**Â Some method, technique, etc., may have been the right answer 100 times, but on the 101st time it's possible that another way could be the best path.\n- **Open Source is crucial:**Â As a company, we're very involved with open source, we are active consumers and contributors to multiple projects. We feel so strongly about this that if we find that a particular internal library could be beneficial to the outside world, then we take the time to package it up and open source it as a standalone library (we did exactly this for a Django SAML2 authentication back end).","location":"United States","original":true,"url":"https://remoteok.io/remote-jobs/101326-remote-aws-focused-site-reliability-engineer-zibasec","apply_url":"https://remoteok.io/l/101326"},{"slug":"101333-remote-tools-architect-bose-corporation","id":"101333","epoch":"1610472262","date":"2021-01-12T17:24:22+00:00","company":"Bose Corporation","company_logo":"","position":"Tools Architect","tags":["architecture"],"logo":"https://assets.landing.jobs/attachments/companies/logos/dba078c9edc995c872fbf85a39c9e7792b907914/small.png?1567675925","description":"<p><!--block--></p><p><strong>About Us</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><!--block--></p><p>At Bose, better sound is just the beginning.

We work with purpose and meaning â for ourselves, and for our users.\n\n[Bravely](http://www.getbravely.com) is a small, young startup building a mental health solution that is desperately needed today (especially for 2020). We give people the ability to (a) track physiological factors that influence mental health, and (b) access evidence-based, therapy methods & psychology knowledge that is currently only found in dry, boring textbooks.\n\nWeâll have fun, learn as we go, and build something weâre excited by. This is a chance to create something with the potential to help millions around the globe. We want someone we trust to join us in the driverâs seat, helping to steer Bravely towards its mission.\n\n\n**What working with us looks like:**\n\n* Weâre young, but ambitious â Itâs still very early days for Bravely, but we know itâs the start of something epic. We know itâll take hard work and learning to get there, but weâre absurdly passionate and stubbornly determined to build something that will help people around the world.\n* Weâre always learningâ Products never succeed in a silo. Theyâre only successes when theyâre in the hands of people, and they donât want to let go! We strive to always be learning; be it new research studies, constant user feedback, or a new design methodology.\n* We value teamwork & collaborationâ They say Rome wasnât built in a day, but it also wasnât built alone. We work together, not apart in silos.\n* We value initiative âWeâre not looking for mindless drones! The business is in everyoneâs hands, not the select few. If youâve opinions or feedback, we want to hear it.\n* Weâre remote & flexible â We donât believe in rigid work schedules or the old-school management method of watching your every move (rolls eyes). We donât compromise on the things that matter (our values, our mission and our users), but we leave a lot of the rest up to you (your hours, your attire, etc.). The position is fully remote, so you have the flexibility to be wherever you need to be.\n* We value taking care of your mental health â It goes without saying that we value good mental health for everyone on the team. To quantify that: taking mental health days is not only allowed, but expected. Our flexible working policy means youâre free to schedule a therapy session for yourself in the middle of your work day, or arrange for your work day to fit around your needs.\n* We have fun too! â Work takes up way too much of your life to not have fun while working. We work hard, but we make sure weâre creating a healthy, friendly and fun work environment too. Team culture is something we never lose sight of.\n\n**What does the right person look like?**\n\n* This is for the role of lead developer. Youâll be in charge of leading the development of the Bravely app together with designers and researchers.\n* Youâll have had prior experience building mobile apps with React Native. Any experience with leading the development of a product in a startup will be highly valuable. Any experience with psychology, therapy or mental health will also be helpful, but not necessary.\n* You should be responsible, proactive, and organised, with a personal belief in constantly improving and iterating. We want to explicitly state that you can be of any nationality, race, gender, sexual orientation or religion. The only requirement we have is for you to be open-minded and tolerant of anyone different to you. And if youâre the type to share funny video alongside thoughtful articles, we welcome you with open arms!\n* Bravely is fully bootstrapped. Weâre on the lookout for someone to join us in the important lead developer role for SGD 5k / month. We aim to give vested stock options to our early founding members.\n\n**What skills and traits are we looking for?**\n\n* A strong background of at least 3 years working with React Native. Experience with React on web would be ideal, but mobile is the definite priority.\n* Experience as a lead developer on digital products.\n* Someone who believes in user-research and design-led products.\n* Familiar with startup minded businesses â specifically with being lean, agile and to expect iterations with continuous user feedback.\n* Ability and ambitious to one day lead a development team.\n* Possession of a clear, organised workflow, who writes clean, well-maintained code.\n* An awesome attitude + no ego + team-player (no lone wolves).\n* Constantly learning and sharing knowledge + seeks out, appreciates and also returns feedback.\n* Experience with working remotely is ideal but not necessary.","location":"Worldwide","original":true,"url":"https://remoteok.io/remote-jobs/101262-remote-react-native-lead-developer-bravely-mental-health","apply_url":"https://remoteok.io/l/101262"},{"slug":"101256-remote-software-development-engineer-front-end-drivewealth-technologies","id":"101256","epoch":"1610242933","date":"2021-01-10T01:42:13+00:00","company":"DriveWealth Technologies","company_logo":"https://remoteok.io/assets/jobs/5aa0341c8eba3ae7022e1ee046dec5e71611388857.png","position":"Software Development Engineer Front End (Jersey City, NJ)","tags":["front end","dev","engineer","digital nomad"],"logo":"https://remoteok.io/assets/jobs/5aa0341c8eba3ae7022e1ee046dec5e71611388857.png","description":"<p>The FrontEnd (JavaScript) Engineering Team works with the Platform and REST API teams to deliver world-class web applications.

We use carefully measured data to attribute leads to individual articles (more detail about why weâre different than most agencies [in this post](https://growandconvert.com/top-content-marketing-agency/)). We have a wide range of clients from B2B services, to SaaS, to select B2C companies. \n\nOur team is 100% remote (and will always be). Our clients are worldwide, although most are in the U.S.\n\n**About this role**\n\nWe drive traffic to every article we publish for our clients with paid social advertising. This is also one of our key differentiators as a content agency. Most agencies donât do much promotion of the content they publish. We use our own budget to drive extremely targeted traffic (that gets as close to the clientâs target customer profile as possible) to each article. This exposes it to the right audience immediately and drives immediate conversions. \n\nWeâre looking for someone to come in and own paid content promotion for all of our clients. \n\nWe currently use another agency to manage all of our paid ads, and while weâre happy with the performance theyâve been able to achieve, longer term, we think this expertise needs to be in-house so we can continue to improve it, invest in it, and scale it. \n\nBut whatâs nice is youâll be walking into an existing process and foundation and building and improving paid ad performance from there. So, weâre looking for a smart, creative paid ads manager who can come in and bring ideas to improve the existing account structure and performance.\n\nThe two main paid channels that we use to drive traffic and conversions to our content are Facebook and Twitter. That said, weâre open to other channels that can drive qualified traffic to our content as well (Reddit, Quora, things we havenât thought of yet).\n\nYouâll be responsible for managing ads for around 15 accounts in the short term, and over the next year, weâre looking to scale that number to over 30.\n\n[This article explains our current approach to paid advertising](https://growandconvert.com/content-marketing/content-distribution-strategy/) and how this fits into the big picture.\n\n**Responsibilities**:\n\n* Manage paid ad spend across all of our clients\n* Test 3 new articles per month per client, and make decisions around which content makes sense to continue advertising based on performance\n* Determine what channel or mix of channels makes the most sense for each client (ie. Facebook, Twitter, something else?)\n* Work with our content strategist team to help them achieve their goals for each client\n\n**Your background**\n* You should have prior experience running direct response Facebook campaigns and/or have used Facebook to drive traffic to blog posts\n* You should have a proficiency in Google Analytics\n* You should have experience managing multiple campaigns at once\n\nThe role will start as a contract position with the possibility of moving to full-time down the road. Weâd estimate that this will take around 10-20 hrs per week to start.\n\n**Compensation:**\n\n$250/month per account, so when the candidate manages all 15 accounts, that would be $3750 per month. Weâll start by testing a candidate on one account, the two, then three and rapidly scaling to all 15 from there. Then if that goes well weâll discuss further growth and a potential full time role down the road. \n\n","location":"PST-EST Timezone","original":true,"url":"https://remoteok.io/remote-jobs/101233-remote-paid-ads-consultant-grow-and-convert","apply_url":"https://remoteok.io/l/101233"},{"slug":"101236-remote-software-developer-vpl","id":"101236","epoch":"1610122758","date":"2021-01-08T16:19:18+00:00","company":"VPL","company_logo":"","position":"Software Developer","tags":["dev","digital nomad"],"description":"<strong>Who We Are</strong><br /><br />VPL is a leader in delivering supply chain technology and solutions to the healthcare market.

That means the usual like version control, testing, and refactoring; but also good object-oriented design, DRY, SRP,â¦\n* You're aware of the trade-offs involved in proper engineering and can make balanced business decisions, keeping in mind all the stakeholders of the project.\n* Youâve got opinions on code design and you can stand by them, but youâre professional enough to not let them get in the way of a consensus if necessary.\n* You have good knowledge and foresight of potential performance issues that might arise when working with large datasets.\n* Weâre not only working with our own API but also a bunch of external parties who speak JSON, REST, XML, or SOAP.

If you've ever had a maintenance issue at your housing rental, you know how much of a pain it can be to get it fixed quickly and reliably. This pain is felt by everyone involved, from the resident to the coordinator to the technician doing the actual repairs. It doesn't have to be this way.</p><br /><p>Our mission is threefold:&nbsp;</p><br /><p>&nbsp;1. Provide a positive experience for all participants in the property maintenance process&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br /><p>&nbsp;2. Intelligently improve efficiency</p><br /><p>3. Deliver transparency and a sense of control</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re a small but growing company with funding and hundreds of happy customers. Over the past five years, we&rsquo;ve homed in on the challenges our customers face when running their maintenance department, namely, running an efficient maintenance department requires cooperation, communication, and the ability to see through the fog to focus on what actually matters. The stakes are high for our customers. A bad maintenance experience is the number one reason renters move out when they otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t have. If property repairs take too long or cost too much property managers are on the hook both financially and legally. With over 30 million units for rent in the United States alone the opportunity is sizeable.</p><br /><p>Your contributions will be critical to the success of our customers and Property Meld.

We&rsquo;re pragmatic about engineering decisions and prioritize rapidly and consistently delivering value to our customers above all else.</p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll have the freedom to choose how to solve problems, given the constraints of the business and infrastructure. With this freedom, you&rsquo;ll be expected to make sound decisions and to swiftly iterate on them until they are either successful or we&rsquo;ve learned a new direction would be more prudent.

This is something we're happy to discuss once you've gotten further along in the application process.\n\nWP Buffs is a revenue-funded business, meaning we have to be selective with our spending. We cannot afford exorbitant salaries like massive, funded companies can. If you're looking for a big payday or a salary commensurate with a $100M+ company, you probably shouldn't apply because you'll be disappointed with our offer from a financial perspective. But if working remotely, joining a fantastic team, working on fun, challenging WordPress problems and coming to a place where your rate of learning will increase exponentially gets your blood pumping, we'd love you to apply.\n\n**Equal opportunity employer:**\n\nAt WP Buffs, we donât just accept difference â we celebrate it, we support it, and we thrive on it for the benefit of our employees, our products, and our community.

Sometimes biases are unconscious and hidden. Diversity programs and training might not work as expected. And good intentions are often inadequate. That's why we're always working to improve in this area and welcome an open dialogue. Email us anytime at careers@wpbuffs.com to help us be a better equal opportunity employer.\n\n**Getting your application noticed:**\n\nWe receive 100s of applications for each position here at WP Buffs.

If it sounds like you would enjoy working with us, donât hesitate to apply or drop us a line with questions on [engineering-jobs@silverfin.com](mailto:engineering-jobs@silverfin.com).\n\nAhum. Here it comes.\n\n\n### Whatâs a Silverfin?\n\nAt Silverfin weâre trying to apply the promise of software to the age-old industry of accounting. With our SaaS weâre automating a large chunk of the busy-work that accountants are currently handling manually, and are building new tools so they can provide better services to their customers. We aim to optimize their workflow in such a way that accountants can spend more time on the much more impactful and rewarding work of advising their customers, the business owners.\n\nThe good news is weâre succeeding in doing exactly that. Every day more than 15.000 financial service professionals use Silverfin to help and advise more than 200.000 businesses. Our customers adore us! The even better news is thereâs still plenty left to work on, and thatâs where we hope you come in.\n\n\n\n### What makes the engineering team at Silverfin special?\n\nWeâre a remote-first engineering team of 25 people distributed in 14 different countries. A priority for us is maintaining proper work-life balance. We avoid meetings as much as possible, accept deadlines only when absolutely necessary, and never expect anyone to work longer hours than theyâve signed up for. A day in our working lives is pretty boring in this regard, and we feel thatâs exactly how it should be.\n\nWorking with us means you can be flexible with your schedule. Itâs OK to disappear for a few hours in the middle of the day to run some errands, get a haircut, pick up the kids â whatever reason, you donât need to explain yourself. You also fully decide when you take time off: our team is sufficiently varied and well organized that there are always enough people around to handle the load, and in the rare cases itâs not, we will decrease the load instead of asking people to move their holiday.\n\nBeing remote-first means we favor asynchronous communication. We donât shy away from chatting in Slack, but the important decisions or discussions are done in Gitlab issues, over email, or in our wiki, so thereâs a written, persisted record. Weâre mindful of maintaining long chunks of focussed time, which means we avoid @-mentions or PMs on Slack, and other triggers and interrupts. We encourage using Slackâs DnD function, especially when youâre not working!\n\nWeâd be really happy to welcome you in our #dev channel, but itâs not just virtual: we make sure we regularly get to see each other in real life too. Twice a year we fly the whole engineering team together to a different location in Europe, and at least once a year we join up with the rest of the company so we can spend some time together with the other departments.\n\n\n\n### What does working at Silverfin look like?\n\nWe work in nimble teams around 5 people in size, with each team taking ownership of a specific set of features of the application. Teams are responsible for a full slice across the stack, so both the backend as well as the frontend of each part is maintained by the same people.\n\nYouâll be supported by our UI designer who develops and maintains HTML and CSS components into a reusable UI-framework, and even builds Vue.js prototypes where necessary, handling compatibility problems with different browsers for you, and making sure everything is responsive as well.\n\nOur ops team ensures things run smoothly, deploys happen correctly, and will work with you when issues should arise. Weâre enthusiastic followers of the devops mindset, which means ops and developers work together to solve problems, and empower each-other to be self-sufficient, instead of throwing problems over the wall to the âother sideâ.\n\nOur stack is Vue.js and vanilla JS with a sprinkling of jQuery on the frontend and an up-to-date Rails monolith on the backend. We use PostgreSQL and Redis for persistence and caching, and everything is running on a Kubernetes cluster in Google Cloud. Our daily tools include GitLab, Quip and Slack, with Zoom as our remote conferencing tool of choice.\n\nNo code gets deployed without a code-review by a peer and testing is a must. Our pipeline automates deployment when the suite is green, and deploys happen dozens of times a day. Each team is currently doing Kanban, but theyâre free to follow whatever process suits them best. There are regular retros held to work towards continuous improvement.\n\nSoftware for accountants is not considered to be very exciting, but we have our fair share of technical challenges. To give you a sense of scale: our database exceeds 7TB, and our largest table recently crossed the 10 billion row mark. We interface with more than 30 different external APIs, and provide third parties an API of our own.\n\n*: Our ops team noted that this actually isnât that hard to achieve if youâre just indexing everything, but it still sounds impressive, right?\n\n\n\n### What does your future look like?\n\nPersonal growth is key to staying motivated. At Silverfin you donât need to move to management in order to get promoted. We see the individual contributor track and the management track as two different growth paths which every engineer can follow and switch between. You can be promoted, including pay raises, as a contributor just like as a manager.\n\nEveryone has a â¬1000 yearly budget to spend on conferences, courses, workshops or other training to improve their skills and level up. This also includes accommodation, travel costs. If the conference is on a workday youâll get paid like any normal day. Silverfin colleagues regularly visit conferences across the world. Are you going to Euruko this year? Come say hi!\n\nWeâre looking to hire a lot of new colleagues, and by the end of the year weâd like to have a couple of more teams. Each new team would also need a new teamlead, and we prefer to promote from within the engineering team. This means if youâd like to step onto the management track, there will be plenty of opportunities to do so in the near future. We pro-actively keep track of who would be interested, and provide feedback and learning opportunities to work towards such a goal.\n\n\n\n### What are we looking for?\n\n* Youâre experienced in both Ruby and Rails, and also understand where the boundaries lie between them. You can code in Ruby without any of Railsâ training wheels if necessary.\n* Youâre up for mentoring coworkers and can give in-depth, productive feedback during code reviews. While you appreciate the small stuff, you recognize bikeshedding and can avoid its pitfalls.\n* You code with reason and can justify the important decisions you made during development.\n* You can communicate clearly in English, both written and verbally.\n* You know and can apply best practices when relevant. That means the usual like version control, testing, and refactoring; but also higher level concepts such as good object oriented design.\n* You're aware of the trade-offs involved in proper engineering and can make balanced business decisions, keeping in mind all the stakeholders of the project.\n* Youâve got opinions on code design and you can discuss them, but youâre professional enough to not let those opinions get in the way of a consensus if necessary.\n\n\n\n### What can we offer you?\n\n* Actual, proper work-life balance\n* A salary range of â¬60.000 - â¬100.000 a year\n* Choose your own working hours and work 100% remotely\n* Personal growth training and opportunities\n* Join a distributed remote-first engineering team with 25 colleagues in 14 different countries\n* A refreshing work environment with professional, friendly and welcoming colleagues\n* A â¬1000 yearly budget for conferences, courses, workshops or other expenses that will improve your skills\n\n\n\n### Requirements\n\n* You have at least 4 years of experience working with Ruby, or 2 years of experience with Ruby and 4 years in one or more other programming language.\n* You get Rails\n* Your work hours have some overlap with EU business hours (we require your local timezone to be within CET +/- 3h)\n\n\n### Nice to haveâs\n\nThese would be nice but are definitely not necessary. Donât worry if none of the following applies to you.\n\n* Experience as a remote worker in a fully remote team\n* Experience with Javascript (ES6) and frontend frameworks\n* Experience working with large datasets and the problems they bring\n* Experience in Fintech\n* Accounting knowledge","location":"Worldwide","original":true,"url":"https://remoteok.io/remote-jobs/101100-remote-senior-ruby-engineer-silverfin","apply_url":"https://remoteok.io/l/101100"},{"slug":"101122-remote-devops-engineer-kontist","id":"101122","epoch":"1609830709","date":"2021-01-05T07:11:49+00:00","company":"Kontist","company_logo":"https://remoteok.io/assets/jobs/89058ce93d1614e36f233b0ef9b727231609860696.png","position":"DevOps Engineer","tags":["aws","infrastructure","cd","ci","monitoring","cloudformation","terraform","docker","kubernetes","shell","python","ruby","devops","engineer","devops","ruby"],"logo":"https://remoteok.io/assets/jobs/89058ce93d1614e36f233b0ef9b727231609860696.png","description":"### About the job\n* Take full ownership of our cloud infrastructure on AWS \n* Continuously improve the reliability, stability, and performance of the infrastructure\n* Ensure infrastructure security and perform routine security audit \n* Build out robust monitoring and alerting systems\n\n\n### Your profile\n* Agile experience and mindset \n* Confident, assertive and communicative \n* Intimate knowledge of AWS ecosystem\n* Experience in managing infrastructure-as-code\n* Configuration management, CD/CI \n* CloudFormation and/or Terraform \n* Virtualization technology: docker, kubernetes \n* Strong programming skills in Shell, Python, or Ruby \n* Proficiency in English\n\n\n### Whatâs in it for you\n* Open to both full-time position as well as 100% remote\n* A highly motivated and ambitious working environment in a cohesive, fast-growing team \n* A multicultural, diverse, and inclusive community where you can grow personally and professionally, including possibilities to move internally within the company \n* Lovely sunny and green office in central Berlin with office dogs \n* Flexible, trust-based working hours \n* Personal coaching \n* Regular team events and company off-sites \n* Weekly German and English classes \n* Sponsored daily on-site lunches \n* Urban Sports Club Membership\n\n\n#### *Please do not apply if you are not able to work during our core working hours (10:00 - 16:00 CEST).

We have over six million registered users from around the world. Our primary product is an online, real-time collaborative editor for papers, theses, technical reports and other documents written in the LaTeX markup language.\n\n## Who We Are\n\nOverleaf was founded by two mathematicians who were inspired by their own experiences in academia to create a better solution for scientific collaboration and communication. Now we are a team of about forty with fifteen developers, based mainly in and around the UK and in the US. We were recently recognised as one of the [UK's top 100 fastest growing businesses](https://www.overleaf.com/blog/overleaf-recognized-as-one-of-the-uks-top-100-fastest-growing-businesses) and as the [Best SaaS for Nonprofits or Education](https://www.overleaf.com/blog/overleaf-named-2020-saas-awards-winner) in the 2020 SaaS Awards Program.\n\n## Our Tech\n\nOverleaf is based on open source software, and most of our product code is itself open source. You can find it on GitHub: https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf (note: most activity is in the repos linked from there).\n\nWe run a mainly Node.js back end using MongoDB, PostgreSQL and Redis. We use a microservices architecture, with about a dozen services. On the front end, we mainly use Angular v1 and are incrementally migrating to React.\n\nWe're hosted on Google Cloud Platform using Google Kubernetes Engine. We use Docker to manage our development environments. We support continuous delivery and typically deploy at least a few times a day (less on Fridays).\n\n## How We Work\n\nOverleaf is remote-first --- all founders and staff work remotely. We also have an office in Farringdon for those in the London area, and when the pandemic settles down we'll again get the whole team together in London a few times a year for face-to-face time.\n\nWe encourage flexible working. Our core hours are 2pmâ5pm UK time, during which our development teams have 10â15 minute daily standup calls. We have few standing meetings for developers, but we do many smaller video or voice calls for pairing or within teams.\n\nWe always collect user feedback to inform our work. We have UX professionals on our team, and we run many surveys and user interviews.\n\nWe organize our work with Kanban. We use GitHub pull requests for each feature with code review to share knowledge and best practices (and catch bugs). We test thoroughly with automated unit and acceptance tests, supported by continuous integration (CI). We're also fans of linting to minimise bike-shedding (and to catch bugs).\n\n## About This Role\n\nWe plan to add two developers to our team, both with a backend focus. Experience with some of Node.js, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis or Kubernetes is desirable. We are also particularly interested in meeting you if:\n\n- you'd be interested in taking up a team lead role in the not too distant future, or\n- you have experience with setting up data pipelines for web analytics and/or business intelligence.\n\nKey projects on our road map this year include:\n\n- Improve our B2C conversion metrics and monitoring â we'll be setting up a new web analytics system to generate insights we need while continuing to respect user privacy\n- Consolidate our two project history systems â we currently have two from our integration with ShareLaTeX in 2017, each with hundreds of TB to be consolidated\n- Make our project PDF preview faster and less bandwidth hungry â we have prototypes showing big wins that now need productionizing\n\nHere are some examples of projects (large and small) we've recently completed:\n\n- https://www.overleaf.com/blog/new-feature-file-outline-is-now-available-on-overleaf\n- https://www.overleaf.com/blog/new-feature-transfer-project-ownership-on-overleaf\n- https://www.overleaf.com/blog/523-a-data-driven-approach-to-latex-autocomplete\n\nIn the longer term, we are planning projects around improved collaboration features for teams, improvements to our rich text mode, and more.\n\n## How We Hire\n\nThe stages in our hiring process are typically:\n\n1. We will aim to update you on the status of your application within 14 days from when we receive it.\n\n2. We'll follow up by email (or sometimes schedule a phone call) with any questions we have about your application, usually around logistics, your ambitions and your expectations about the role.\n\n3. We'll schedule a more in-depth interview, which is typically two hours long. The first hour is discussion, and the second hour is technical. For the technical, you'll have the option of either completing a homework assignment, which requires about one hour of your time before the interview, or solving a problem in the interview, if you prefer. The problems are practical in nature (no fizz-buzz or reversing linked lists), and you can use Google, man pages, etc., and ask us questions.\n\n4. We'll make an offer. We usually interview in batches, so there may be a short delay while we interview other candidates, but we will try to keep you informed throughout the process.\n\nIf you have a deadline, please let us know in your application, and we will try to be accommodating.\n\n## Requirements\n\nWe require that you:\n\n- have a minimum of 2â3 years of relevant experience (we aren't taking on more new graduates at the moment).\n- will work for us full time (or nearly full time).\n- will usually be available in our core hours, 2pmâ5pm UK time.\n\nApplicants in the UK, Europe, US and Canada are preferred.\n\nExperience with the technologies we use is always a plus, but you don't need to know them all; your ability to learn is much more important to us.\n\n## Benefits\n\n- Remote and flexible working.\n- Salary Â£40kâÂ£75k per year depending on experience.\n- You would join a small, dedicated and growing team.\n- We're substantially (around 80%) open source, so your work will often be on open source code.\n- We're backed by Bethnal Green Ventures (https://bethnalgreenventures.com/) and Digital Science (https://www.digital-science.com/), through which we're part of a wider community of startups in science, health and ed-tech.\n- Our London office is shared with several other Digital Science companies, so there's lots of interesting people to meet, and clubs and sports activities outside of work.\n- We get everyone together in London for team meetings several times a year for valuable face-to-face time (pandemic permitting).\n- You can pick your own equipment. MacBook Pro? Lenovo ThinkPad? Notebook and pen? However you like to work, we'll provide what you need.\n- We provide a training budget; many of our developers choose to attend relevant industry conferences or buy training materials.\n- We run quarterly [remote hackathons](https://www.overleaf.com/blog/overleafs-remote-hackathon-revisited-one-year) to keep learning and experimenting.\n- We run a weekly internal seminar series with short talks from staff about their work or personal projects, new technologies and techniques.\n\nWe are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.","location":"US, Canada, UK, Europe","original":true,"url":"https://remoteok.io/remote-jobs/101098-remote-software-developer-overleaf","apply_url":"https://remoteok.io/l/101098"},{"slug":"101096-remote-senior-react-native-engineer","id":"101096","epoch":"1609773543","date":"2021-01-04T15:19:03+00:00","company":"","company_logo":"","position":"Senior React Native Engineer","tags":["react native","react","javascript","senior","engineer"],"description":"Q","location":"","url":"https://remoteok.io/remote-jobs/101096-remote-senior-react-native-engineer","apply_url":"https://remoteok.io/l/101096"},{"slug":"101094-remote-frontend-engineer","id":"101094","epoch":"1609768852","date":"2021-01-04T14:00:52+00:00","company":"","company_logo":"","position":"Frontend Engineer","tags":["front end","engineer"],"description":"S","location":"","url":"https://remoteok.io/remote-jobs/101094-remote-frontend-engineer","apply_url":"https://remoteok.io/l/101094"},{"slug":"101089-remote-senior-frontend-engineer-img-ly","id":"101089","epoch":"1609758564","date":"2021-01-04T11:09:24+00:00","company":"IMG.LY","company_logo":"https://remoteok.io/assets/jobs/628ff95eccd804fe83e5592da350c7171609758564.png","position":"Senior Frontend Engineer","tags":["sdk","startup","design","photoeditor","saas","react","javascript","front end","senior","engineer","digital nomad"],"logo":"https://remoteok.io/assets/jobs/628ff95eccd804fe83e5592da350c7171609758564.png","description":"**Who we are**\nHi!

An Experiment Engineer manufactures HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript code to run on top of client websites that alters the experience of the site in an effort to improve the conversion rates of key performance metrics.  They are comfortable working across a variety of different front-end frameworks and libraries as well as APIs.  They must also be comfortable working to validate concepts by choosing the cheapest route to MVP versus over-engineering any particular task.  They are familiar with CRO platforms such as Optimizely, Convert, VWO, and Google Optimize.\n\n**Responsibilities include:**\n\n* Develops efficient and robust experimentation code using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript which is injected on top of existing client sites via experimentation software such as Optimizely, Convert, and VWO.\n* Engages as a technical consultant, providing web development expertise and insights, on internal and client-facing video calls.  \n* Communicates thoroughly and sets clear expectations with Project Managers, Quality Assurance Analysts, and clients.\n* Offers ideas and provides feedback to help grow and scale Cro Metrics as a business.\n\n**Qualifications & Experience:**\n\nThis is a high communication role, and while no specific experience is required, you must be capable of learning new technical concepts quickly, regularly, and be able to communicate with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.\n\n* 2+ years of experience writing HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript in a professional environment.\n* Critical thinking â You can analyze a problem, craft a solution, and love iterating on your own processes. Every experiment is unique and has a different set of challenges so we often find ourselves in uncharted waters.\n* Attention to detail â You have high attention to visual detail, can interpret specifications, can communicate detailed instructions, and leave no edge case unattended.\n* Updates internal documentation to help ensure site caveats and learnings are available and disseminated to peers.\n* Proficiency with Google Suite (Gmail, calendars, spreadsheets, etc).\n\n**Nice-to-haves:**\n\n* Experience with A/B/n tests or with leading testing platforms such as Optimizely, Convert, VWO, etc.\n* Experience with Jira, Confluence, Slack, and Zoom.\n* Has worked in professionally in eCommerce or web-development, especially modern frameworks (Shopify, WordPress, etc.) and libraries (React, Angular, etc).\n* Computer Science degree or professional experience in back-end development.\n* Experience working fully remotely.\n* Knowledge of User Experience concepts.\n* Knowledge of Agile concepts.\n* Agency experience.\n\n**Our Hiring Process**\n\nWeâre glad youâre interested in working with us. We have a fairly unusual hiring process, but it has proven to work well both for us and for potential new hires. We have found that demonstrating basic competency is the best predictor of initial qualification for working with us, followed by actual work.\n\nOur process reflects that: below, we outline our values and how we work, and then ask you to complete a small task. Assuming we like your response, we will hire you for a âpaid interviewâ where you start working with us for a small number of hours each week. If both parties like working together, we expand the relationship. If not, we go our separate ways and both sides âwonâ in the deal!\n\nIf you have questions as you go through this, make notes and if we havenât answered them by the end, feel free to email matthew.gossage@crometrics.com or brian.norman@crometrics.com. \n\n**Company Benefits**\n\n* 100% remote, continue to work from where you are based\n* Health insurance reimbursement allowance\n* Retirement plan with 4% company match (subject to a 3 month waiting period)\n* Professional gear (e.g. MacBook, monitor, and noise-canceling headset)\n* Annual All Hands trips\n* Paid Parental Leave\n* Liberal vacation policy\n* Access to group performance coaching sessions\n\n**Our Culture**\n\n* **Remote has always been our thing.** Weâve been fully remote since 2010, so unlike companies that have been remote since March of 2020, we designed our company and culture behind the principles of high-performing remote teams. Weâve always believed remote is the future of work, and much like the experimentation we do, have iterated a lot along the way in a persistent effort to get it right.\n* **Weâre a remote company.** We are spread out all over the country. Daytime availability is required for syncing with the team via Slack or Zoom, but Experiment Engineers enjoy all the flexibility remote working has to offer. Want to go on a mountain bike ride in the middle of the day? Cool, donât forget your helmet! Need to pick the kids up from school? Nice, youâve got parent of the year in the bag. We stay connected through both synchronous and asynchronous communications.\n* **We value elegant code as much as you do, but we move fast.** Weâre writing code that runs on top of existing websites. Some tests only run for a few days before disappearing (though some do so well they become a permanent part of the clientâs site). There will be polling patterns and liberal use of !important.\n* **Again, weâre a remote company.** That makes communication â including writing and reading comprehension â extremely important. This is not a simple âpull tickets and give sign offâ gig. Successful applicants enjoy collaborating across teams, defining and clarifying needs, documenting processes, improving processes, and uploading custom emoji to Slack.\n\nYou can read more about our [culture and values here](https://crometrics.com/culture/) or [learn more about the team](https://crometrics.com/meet-the-team/).\n\n**Our Stack**\n\n* **Email/Calendar:** GSuite\n* **CRO Platforms:** Optimizely, VWO, Google Optimize, Convert, AB Tasty\n* **IDE:** Your choice.  Most of our folks use VSCode.\n* **Messaging App:** Slack\n* **Video Chat:** Zoom\n* **Task Management:** Jira \n* **Documentation:** Confluence\n* **Code Repository:** GitHub\n* **Time Tracking Software:** Harvest\n* **Design Prototyping Software:** Figma \n\nAt Cro Metrics, our goal is to create a remote environment that celebrates the differences that make us, us. We strive to create an inclusive and equitable space, but we realize we donât always get it right. Weâre continually working together to create mutual respect and opportunities to learn from one another and we encourage people of color, women, individuals with disabilities, and LGBTQIA+ individuals to apply.\n\nWeâre looking for team members located in the U.S. regardless of race, ethnicity, age, national origin, marital status, parental status, veteran status, citizenship status, gender, gender-identity/expression, sexual orientation, disability, genetic information, and any other protected or unprotected class we may have missed.

Or use our library of evergreen literature on back-end and front-end subjects to broaden your horizon.\n\n**You and our future-proof stack**\n\n* We seek a balance between sticking with what works and fearlessly exploring the new.\n* We use the latest stable version of PHP 7 because it allows us to write better code using features like strict type declarations, typed class properties and arrow functions.\n* We leverage the elegance, simplicity and readability of the latest Laravel version.\n* We want to spend our precious time on things that matter the most; that's why we perfect our easy to run development environment with Homestead and custom scripts.\n* We write and run tests with PHPUnit and cypress.io.\n* We have a great set of tools to maintain the code quality and run on CI/CD (psalm (error level 4), rector, phpcs, php-cs-fixer, phpcpd etc.)\n* We use Rector to maintain our code quality.\n* Weâre constantly refactoring our front-end code with the goal of reaching front-end heaven:\n\t* Laravel Blade template engine.\n\t* PostCSS to maximize the power of modern CSS.\n\t* Webpack for perfect control over front-end assets.\n\t* Latest JS with support for ES2020 features. To accomplish this we use the latest Babel releases.\n\t* BEM/ITCSS in combination with Tailwind CSS based utility classes.\n\t* A custom-made design system (https://design-system.interaction-design.org) to achieve consistency and ease of use.\n\nForget IE and clunky workarounds for compatibility with other dinosaur browsers: We spend our time only on modern Web APIs since we only support evergreen browsers.\n\nWe â¤ CI (Continuous Integration) and CD (Continuous Delivery) so we usually deploy a few releases per day: Zero downtime. Just a few buttons to push. No sweaty palms.\n\nWe care deeply about Developer Experience (DX) of our codebase and tools. DX and DevOps is our middle name: Git, GitHub, HTTP/2, Assets CDN, AWS, Enterprise SSDs on our high-spec servers, and much more.\n\n**About you**\n\n* You have expert knowledge of PHP.\n* You have expert knowledge of Laravel or Symfony.\n* You have experience with test-driven development (TDD).\n* You have 6+ years of experience working professionally with OOP.\n* Your work is based on a solid foundation in computer science fundamentals from data structures and algorithms to design patterns.\n* You are an engineer by mindset and always try to understand how things work under the hood.\n* You have substantial experience working with RESTful web services and ORM concepts.\n* You love to learn through doing. Youâre ready to put in some hard work to expand your skills.\n* You speak and write acceptable English â not perfect English, just acceptable â since you will be working with people from the US, England, Canada, Denmark, Belarus and Brazil among others.\n* You are a team player and you don't bring your ego to work. \n* You are self-motivated and self-disciplined and thus work well in a flat hierarchy with lots of freedom.\n* You love to have creative freedom, make independent judgments and live up to the responsibility that comes with that freedom.\n* You love to create tangible resultsâevery hour and every day.\n* You love to make a positive impact on the world and the lives of others.\n\n**Bonus points**\n\nYou get bonus pointsâ¦\n* â¦if you have contributed to open source\n* â¦if you have worked professionally with at least one statically typed programming language like C, C++, Java, Kotlin, Rust, Scala, TypeScript, etc.\n* â¦if you have a Masterâs Degree in Computer Science\n","location":"Worldwide","original":true,"url":"https://remoteok.io/remote-jobs/101039-remote-senior-php-developer-interaction-design-foundation","apply_url":"https://remoteok.io/l/101039"},{"slug":"101035-remote-backend-software-engineer-trendhim","id":"101035","epoch":"1608984909","date":"2020-12-26T12:15:09+00:00","company":"Trendhim","company_logo":"","position":"Backend Software Engineer","tags":["golang","dev","engineer","backend","digital nomad"],"description":"Horsens, Denmark - Ready to take your skills to the next level?
